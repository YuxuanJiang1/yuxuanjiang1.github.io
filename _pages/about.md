Shubhashis is a Computer Science PhD Researcher under [Dr. Frank Ferarro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). His research combines **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV).

His current research focuses on outcome and intention based decomposition and how it can be used for video-text retrieval. This research has applications in video/image retrieval system, especially where there is no text available for the video (e.g., most of the videos on the internet, social media, and surveillance videos).

He is also interested about multimodal

reasoning, understanding, and generation. His previous work, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for event representation learning, has applications in text summarization, question answering, and <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="What would happen if some facts are changed?">counterfactual</span> reasoning (Published in **[*SEM 2023, ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.31?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**).

In **Summer 2025**, he is interning at [Amazon Science](https://www.amazon.science/) as a Applied Scientist. He is researching on optimization of Alexa conversation latency, cost and performance.

In **Summer 2024**, he interned at [Scale.AI](https://scale.com) as a Machine Learning Researcher. He explored how <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Reinforcement learning from human feedback">RLHF</span> can improve the text2SQL generation (currently under ARR review). He also worked on Many-Shot text2SQL and text2SQL AutoEval using <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Small Language Model">SLM</span>. He was mentored by [Vijay Kalmath](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vijay-kalmath/) and managed by [Dr. Adrian Lam](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayplam/).

<!-- I completed my M.Sc. in CS with [Phi Kappa Phi](https://phikappaphi.meritpages.com/stories/Shubhashis-Roy-Dipta-Inducted-into-The-Honor-Society-of-Phi-Kappa-Phi/107714395) (**[CGPA 4.0/4.0](/assets/pdf/masters_transcript.pdf?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**)  in Spring 2023 at UMBC. Before my M.Sc., I gained over 3 years of industry experience as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. During that time, I also worked with [Dr. Iman Dehzangi](https://cs.camden.rutgers.edu/faculty-staff/iman-dehzangi-ph-d/) (Rutgers University) and published [4 journal papers](/publications?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). -->

Shubhashis has a strong background in ML programming, including PyTorch, ðŸ¤— HuggingFace, NLTK, Spacy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more. He has excelled in machine learning competitions (**[Kaggle top-70 ðŸ¥‰](/projects/kaggle_bird?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**) and coding competitions (**[ACM ICPC 8th out of 300+ teams](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/dhaka-2019/standings)**) and [more](/awards?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). He was the founder of **[UniShopr](https://unishopr.com)** (2018-2022), a cross-border e-commerce for his home country (Bangladesh).
