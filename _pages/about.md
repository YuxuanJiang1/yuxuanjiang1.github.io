Hello! Iâ€™m Shubhashis Roy Dipta. I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I am working as a Research Assistant under ![Dr. Frank Ferarro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/). Our work combines Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision. My project includes counterfactual story generation from video and story.

Previously, I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer in Sapien.Network, New York, USA. I have 3+ years of experience in the Software Industry. During that time, I have also worked with Dr. Iman Dehzangi (Rutgers University) and published 4 journal papers.

I completed my B.Sc. in CSE from the Military Institute of Science & Technology in 2016 (CGPA 3.51/4.0). I have participated in 30+ programming contests and several app competitions during my undergrad. I completed my M.Sc. in CS with Phi Kappa Phi (CGPA 4.0/4.0) from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in Spring 2023.
