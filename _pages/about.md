I am a PhD Researcher in Computer Science at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/), where I work with [Dr. Frank Ferarro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/) on cutting-edge projects that combine **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV). During past years, I have published papers on top-tier conferences and journals ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j2ElsNIAAAAJ&hl=en)). My previous work involved a hierarchical model to learn event frames and regenerate the events in a semi-supervised way, which can be applied to various domains such as text summarization, question answering, and counterfactual reasoning (Published in [\*SEM 2023, ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.31/)). My current project includes multimodal (language + vision) counterfactual event reasoning, understanding, and generation.

I completed my M.Sc. in CS with [Phi Kappa Phi](https://phikappaphi.meritpages.com/stories/Shubhashis-Roy-Dipta-Inducted-into-The-Honor-Society-of-Phi-Kappa-Phi/107714395) (**[CGPA 4.0/4.0](/assets/pdf/masters_transcript.pdf)**) from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, in Spring 2023. I completed my B.Sc. in CSE from the [Military Institute of Science & Technology](https://mist.ac.bd/) in 2016 (**[CGPA 3.51/4.0](/assets/pdf/bsc_transcript.pdf)**).

Before joining Ph.D., I worked as a Full-Stack Software Engineer in [Sapien.Network](https://www.sapien.network/), New York, USA. I have 3+ years of experience in the Software Industry. During that time, I have also worked with [Dr. Iman Dehzangi](https://cs.camden.rutgers.edu/faculty-staff/iman-dehzangi-ph-d/) ([Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/)) and published [4 journal papers](/publications).

With over 3 years of experience in developing full-stack software solutions for various startups and companies, I have gained proficiency in multiple languages and frameworks such as Node.js, PHP, MySQL, Apollo GraphQL, Elixir, and more. I have also participated and excelled in several coding competitions, such as the ACM ICPC, where I ranked among the top teams in the region (**[8th out of 300+ teams](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/dhaka-2019/standings)**). I am highly enthusiastic and passionate about new technologies and innovations, and I am always eager to learn and improve my skills. I aim to leverage my expertise in NLP, CV, ML, and DL to create impactful and intelligent systems that can enhance human capabilities and well-being.
